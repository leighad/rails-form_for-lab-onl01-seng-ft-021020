# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes
# the StudentsHelper. For example:

# describe StudentsHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
#     end
#   end
# end

# RSpec.describe StudentsHelper, type: :helper do
#   pending "add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}"
# end

# describe 'index page' do 
#   it 'displays each student within <ul> tag' do
#     # visit "/posts/#{@post.id}"
#     visit student_path
#     expect(page).to have_css("ul")
#   end
